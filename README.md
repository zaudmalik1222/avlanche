Here's a README template for your second Solidity code, which is a Vault contract interacting with an ERC20 token:

```markdown
# Solidity Vault Contract

This is a Solidity smart contract for a Vault that interacts with an ERC20 token. It allows users to deposit and withdraw tokens, with shares representing their ownership of the total deposited tokens.

## Contract Details

- **Vault Contract:** `Vault.sol`
- **Token Interface:** `IERC20.sol`

## Description

The `Vault` contract allows users to deposit tokens and receive shares representing their ownership. Users can then withdraw tokens by providing shares. This contract ensures that the total supply of shares always corresponds to the total deposited token amount.

## Functions

### `deposit`
```solidity
function deposit(uint _amount) external
```
Deposits `_amount` of tokens into the vault and mints shares for the depositor.

### `withdraw`
```solidity
function withdraw(uint _shares) external
```
Withdraws tokens from the vault by burning `_shares` of shares and transferring the corresponding amount of tokens to the withdrawer.

## Contract Logic

- `_mint`: Private function to mint shares when tokens are deposited.
- `_burn`: Private function to burn shares when tokens are withdrawn.
- `deposit`: Calculates shares based on the deposited amount and mints shares accordingly.
- `withdraw`: Calculates the amount to withdraw based on shares and burns the corresponding shares.

## Usage

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org) installed
- [Solidity Compiler](https://soliditylang.org/docs/installing-solidity.html) installed

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/solidity-vault.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd solidity-vault
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### Testing

Run tests to ensure the contract functions correctly:
```bash
npx hardhat test
```
